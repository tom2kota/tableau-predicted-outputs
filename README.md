# Tableau Predicted Outputs
In the following example, we will analyse the data stored in the [absent_predictions.csv](https://github.com/tom2kota/tableau-predicted-outputs/blob/main/absent_predictions.csv)

- We will visualize ‘Age’ against ‘Average Probability’ on a scatter plot using Tableau.
- We will plot the different Groups with reasons for absence against ‘Probability’.
- We will visualize ‘Transportation Expense’ against ‘Probability’ on a scatter plot. Then, we will filter by ‘Children’, which will be the data field which determines color and the size of the dots on our scatter plot can be changed to.
